# Router-1-x-3-design
Router 1x3 implementation using  verilog HDL .
Router is device that forwards data packets between computer networks.It is an OSI(OPEN SYSTEMS INTERCONNECTION) layer 3 routing device . It drives an incoming packet to an output channel based on the address field contained in the packet header. 
This project mainly designed based on protocal(TCP/IP)A networking protocol that allows computers to communicate with each other.The Router normal is the two way communication but here in this project we design that is one way communication .
